Math Quiz Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ§®
This Math Quiz Game is a fun and interactive web-based game designed to help users practice basic arithmetic skills, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a simple, user-friendly interface with a visually appealing design.

How It Works:
When the game starts, a random math question is generated involving two numbers and one of three operations: +, -, or *.
Players have 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible.
For each correct answer, the player earns 10 points, which are displayed in real-time on the screen.
The timer counts down from 60 seconds, and once it reaches zero, the game ends, displaying a "Game Over" message.
Players can restart the game using the Restart button, which resets the score and timer and generates a new question.

Features:
Dynamic Question Generation: The game uses JavaScript to generate random math problems each time a new question is needed.
Real-Time Score and Timer: The score and remaining time are displayed and updated dynamically as the game progresses.
Responsive Design: The game interface is styled using CSS, including gradient backgrounds, animated floating bubbles, and modern button designs, ensuring a visually engaging experience.
Restart Functionality: Players can restart the game at any time, resetting all values to their initial states.

Technologies Used:
HTML for structure
CSS for styling, including animations and gradients
JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
